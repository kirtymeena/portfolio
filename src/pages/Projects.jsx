                By the time I decided to start working on this project I had
                just finished learning redux Toolkit and Sass(CSS preprocessor).
                I wanted to code a project to implement all of this knowledge
              </span>
            </p>
            <h2 className="letter-spacing">Lessons learned</h2>
            <p>
              <span>
                I learned about HTML semantics and their importance, though I
                didn't use much of HTML semantics still I read about it and will
                be using it in future projects.
                <p>
                  {" "}
                  I used sass in this project but still I can see the repeation
                  of sass code where I could have created a mixin and reused
                  it(will take care of this in next projects).
                </p>{" "}
                <p>
                  I have already used redux in other project and I feel like
                  redux toolkit reduces the boilerplate code and efforts of
                  writing code.

                I was learning how to make a page or website responsive for
                different screens so I decided to go with this project to test
                it out.{" "}

                  Creating common css classes and reusing them saves a lot of
                  time and efforts.
                </li>
                <li>Resusing react components.</li>
                <li>
                  responsiveness is not actually pain but pretty easy just need
                  to know which approch to use at what time.

                When I started with this project I was strugling with
                responsivness of a website. I was looking for a way to reduce
                media query and after few google search, css grid was the one I
                was looking for. This project was perfect to learn css grid.

            <h2 className="letter-spacing">Lessons learned</h2>
            <p>
              <ul>
                <li>
                  Css grid is amazing, using grids and flex box together can
                  reduce the media quaries.
                </li>
                <li>
                  Grids are mainly used for 2D layout and flex-box is used for
                  1D layout (column or row).
                </li>
                <li>Learned some css functions like minmax() and repeat().</li>
              </ul>
